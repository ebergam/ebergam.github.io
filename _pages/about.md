I am currently working as Research Fellow at the University of Milan-Bicocca.

I earned my Ph.D. in Economics at Collegio Carlo Alberto and University of Turin.

Previously, I worked at the European think tank Bruegel ([publications](https://bruegel.org/author/enrico-bergamini)).

I am an applied econmists and data scientists, working mainly on green industrial policy, economic geography, policy uncertainty, and computational social science. 

I have a strong interest in spatial data science, networks, NLP, scraping and non-conventional (big) data sources.

My publications are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qedxNoIAAAAJ&hl=en).
